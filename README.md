Neovim set-up I've been using. I wanted something as simple as possible without compromising on functionality I need. Ended up finding [this video](https://youtu.be/xGkL2N8w0H4?si=rLDY4VP0aMy1FnFM), which I used as a starting point, and then afterwards changed to make it more comfortable for me.

Uses the vim.pack.add feature so won't work on 0.11 or prior. I'm using nvim 0.12+ (Nightly).

Will also need to install language servers... for me: 
* typescript-language-server
* pyright
* lua-language-server
* rust-analyzer
* clangd
